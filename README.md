# 3D Houses

The purpose of this code is :
Starting with only an address, get a basic 3D of the house.


## Map

### Who
This is a solo project


### Objectives
- Searching for adapted libraries
- Learning to use unexpected libraries
- Working with a new kind of datas (raster datas)
- Using Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib

**Personnal additions**
- Analyzing some of the raster's datas
- Showing some Hillshades and how it works (colors and azimut of the sun)


### When
- Start : 07/10/2020
- Break : 16/10/2020 - 25/10/2020
- Deadline: 01/11/2020


### Where
All the work done was made during the BeCode's AI's formation 2020-2021.

### Limitations

The raster datas are from 2014, and the cadastre is from 2020, meaning that if your input is a building from after 2014 but before 2020, there'll be a polygon for the building, but there won't be any building showing in the 3D.
